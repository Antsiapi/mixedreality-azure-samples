## Solution

(Coming Soon)


## Getting Started

This solution uses the [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) version 2017.4.0.0. However, a copy of the toolkit is **not** included. After cloning this project you can either import the MRTK Unity Package from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/tag/2017.4.0.0) or you can run [MakeLinks.bat](MakeLinks.bat) in the project folder to symbolically link to an existing copy of the MRTK you may already on your drive.  

(More Coming Soon)


## System Requirements
- Unity 2017.2 or later
- `.NET 4.6` under player settings
- `.NET backend` under player settings

Though you will see "Mixed Reality" mentioned throughout this reference, it is not exclusive to Windows Mixed Reality devices. This code will work with all Unity projects that support .NET 4.6. The only exception to this rule is the **Luis Dictation Manager** which needs Windows 10 APIs to access the microphone. This component is optional and will work on all devices that run Windows 10, including HoloLens.
