This samples is demonstrating how you can use [Custom Vision](http://customvision.ai) (one of the Cognitive Services),  export the model to the [onnx format](https://onnx.ai/) and use [Windows ML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/machine-learning/) to run it offline on Hololens.

(Coming soon) Blog article. 

*Note: Everything shown in this code can also work on a classical UWP application (i.e. not Hololens)*
