# MixedReality Azure Samples

**MixedReality Azure Samples** is a collection of samples and reference implementations for using Azure services in simulations. Though "Mixed Reality" is mentioned throughout the project, the vast majority of resources here are not exclusive to Windows Mixed Reality devices. Each sample or reference includes a **System Requirements** section that clearly explains where the code can run.


## Organization

This project is organized into 3 key areas:

### Standalone Samples ###
(Coming soon) are concise projects that demonstrate a capability quickly and don't have external dependencies. These samples can be downloaded independently and tested quickly with little or no server setup.


### Solutions ###
(Coming soon) also demonstrate a single capability but require additional setup. Solutions, for example, may require deploying an Azure workload like a bot, a function, or a database.
 

### Reference Architectures ###
Are *set of capabilities* that have all been designed to work together. For example, Speech Recognition may be used on its own but it is also designed to work with Language Understanding. 

**Modules**
- [LUIS for XR](Assets/MixedRealityAzure/LUIS) - A powerful Natural Language replacement for voice commands.
